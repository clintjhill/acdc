== For Those About To Rock

This is a little XML-to-object-to-XML library that gets Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. 

== Features

* Take XML string objects and convert them to real Ruby objects from your library
* Take real Ruby objects and convert them to XML strings
* Declare XML elements/attributes easily and with type enforcement
* Coerce objects to XML strings automatically (see JAIL_BREAK)

== Usage

=== Element

A basic XML element is created with the use of the following constructor

  require 'acdc'
  elem = Element("Hells Bells")
  puts elem.acdc
  => "<Element>Hells Bells</Element>"
  elem = Element("Hells Bells", {}, "BackInBlack")
  puts elem.acdc
  => "<BackInBlack>Hells Bells</BackInBlack>"

=== It's A Long Way To The Top, If You Want To Rock n Roll

AcDc::Body assists you with declaring XML objects with ease. And #acdc makes
marshaling those objects from XML a breeze.

  require 'acdc'
  class TheJack < AcDc::Body
    attribute :shes_got, "the jack"
    element :big_balls
  end
  rosie = TheJack.new(:big_balls => "I've got big balls")
  puts rosie.big_balls
  => "I've got big balls"
  puts rosie.acdc
  => "<TheJack shes_got="the jack"><BigBalls>I've got big balls</BigBalls></TheJack>"
  who_made_who = acdc("<TheJack><BigBalls>Biggest Balls of them all</BigBalls></TheJack>")
  puts who_made_who.class
  => TheJack
  puts who_made_who.big_balls
  => "Biggest Balls of them all"

=== JAIL_BREAK

JAIL_BREAK will determine whether or not you need to explicitly coerce your
objects to XML using Element#acdc or Body#acdc. It's may not be the smartest
feature in the world, but we're gonna Ride On.

==== Without JAIL_BREAK

  require 'acdc'
  XML_element = Element("TNT")
  puts XML_element
  => #<AcDc::Element:>
  puts XML_element.acdc
  => "<Element>TNT</Element>"

==== With JAIL_BREAK

  JAIL_BREAK = true
  require 'acdc'
  XML_element = Element("TNT")
  puts XML_element
  => "<Element>TNT</Element>"
